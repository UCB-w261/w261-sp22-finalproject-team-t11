# MAGIC %md # Question 1: Distributed Graph Processing
# MAGIC Chapter 5 from Lin & Dyer gave you a high level introduction to graph algorithms and concerns that come up when trying to perform distributed computations over them. The questions below are designed to make sure you captured the key points from this reading and your async lectures. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q1 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ Give an example of a dataset that would be appropriate to represent as a graph. What are the nodes/edges in this dataset? Is the graph you describe 'directed' or 'undirected'? What would the average "in-degree" of a node mean in the context of your example? 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Other than their size/scale, what makes graphs uniquely challenging to work with in the map-reduce paradigm? *(__HINT__: Do not respond in terms of any specific algorithm. Think in terms of the nature of the graph datastructure itself).*
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ Briefly describe Dijskra's algorithm (goal/approach). What specific design component makes this approach hard to parallelize?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) short response:__ How does parallel breadth-first-search get around the problem that you identified in part `c`? At what expense?

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Q1 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ One example of data that can be represented as a graph is a social network: Each person is a node and being friends is a relationship represented by an edge. If two people are friends, they are connected with an edge. Because friendship is not a directional relationship, the edges have no direction, meaning this is an undirected graph. The average in-degree in this example would be the average number of friends a person has.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ Common algorithms and calculations on graphs typically require iterating over other nodes, so it is difficult for a user to separate out parts of a graph for parallel processing. Because of this, it is difficult to parallelize graph algorithms.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __c)__ Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the shortest path between a given node and all other nodes. Dijkstra's Algorithm works on the basis that any subpath B -> D of the shortest path A -> D between vertices A and D is also the shortest path between vertices B and D [[ProgramViz]](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/dijkstra-algorithm). Djikstra uses this property in the opposite direction i.e we overestimate the distance of each vertex from the starting vertex [[ProgramViz]](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/dijkstra-algorithm). Dijkstra's algorithm needs to maintain the state in a priority queue. The insertion operation into a priority queue is a synchronous operation, which makes the algorithm hard to parallelize. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __d)__ Distributed breadth-first search avoids the need for a priority queue by doing the prioritized edge selection in the reduce step. This ensures that the processing of nodes in the frontier can be done in parallel. There is an additional cost involved though as we have to do multiple map-reduce iterations.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md # Question 2: Representing Graphs 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In class you saw examples of adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations of graphs. These data structures were probably familiar from HW3, though we hadn't before talked about them in the context of graphs. In this question we'll discuss some of the tradeoffs associated with these representations. __`NOTE:`__ We'll use the graph from Figure 5.1 in Lin & Dyer as a toy example. For convenience in the code below we'll label the nodes `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E` instead of $n_1$, $n_2$, etc but otherwise you should be able to follow along & check our answers against those in the text.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q2 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ Relatively speaking, is the graph you described in Figure 5.1 in Lin & Dyer "sparse" or "dense"?  Explain how sparsity/density impacts the adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations of a graph.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Run the provided code to create and plot our toy graph. Is this graph directed or undirected? Explain how the adjacency matrices for directed graphs will differ from those of undirected graphs.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) code:__ Fill in the missing code to complete the function `get_adj_matr()`.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code:__ Fill in the missing code to complete the function `get_adj_list()`.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Q2 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ The graph in Figure 5.1 is sparse because it contains less than half of the possible number of edges (9 out of 25). The adjacency matrix therefore is also sparse because it has more zeros than non-zero values.  In the situation of a sparse graph it is best to use an adjacency list. This will take up less space and help reduce computation time. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ This is a directed graph. In an undirected gragh every edge will have an entry for both nodes in the adjacency matrix, creating a symmetric matrix. In a directed graph each edge will have one entry in the adjacency matrix corresponding to the node it is leaving from (the row in Figure 5.1) to the node it is pointing to (the column in Figure 5.1).

# MAGIC %md # Question 3: Markov Chains and Random Walks
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As you know from your readings and in class discussions, the PageRank algorithm takes advantage of the machinery of Markov Chains to compute the relative importance of a webpage using the hyperlink structure of the web (we'll refer to this as the 'web-graph'). A Markov Chain is a discrete-time stochastic process. The stochastic matrix has a principal left eigen vector corresponding to its largest eigen value which is one. A Markov chain's probability distribution over its states may be viewed as a probability vector. This steady state probability for a state is the PageRank of the corresponding webpage. In this question we'll briefly discuss a few concepts that are key to understanding the math behind PageRank. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q3 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ It is common to explain PageRank using the analogy of a web surfer who clicks on links at random ad infinitum. In the context of this hypothetical infinite random walk, what does the PageRank metric measure/represent?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ What is the "Markov Property" and what does it mean in the context of PageRank?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ A Markov chain consists of $n$ states plus an $n\times n$ transition probability matrix. In the context of PageRank & a random walk over the WebGraph what are the $n$ states? what implications does this have about the size of the transition matrix?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code + short response:__ What is a "right stochastic matrix"? Fill in the code below to compute the transition matrix for the toy graph from question 2. [__`HINT:`__ _It should be right stochastic. Using numpy this calculation can be done in one line of code._]
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __e) code + short response:__ To compute the stable state distribution (i.e. PageRank) of a "nice" graph we can apply the power iteration method - repeatedly multiplying the transition matrix by itself, until the values no longer change. Apply this strategy to your transition matrix from `part d` to find the PageRank for each of the pages in your toy graph. Your code should print the results of each iteration. How many iterations does it take to converge? Which node is most 'central' (i.e. highest ranked)? Does this match your intuition? 
# MAGIC     * __`NOTE 1:`__ _this is a naive approach, we'll unpack what it means to be "nice" in the next question_.
# MAGIC     * __`NOTE 2:`__ _no need to implement a stopping criteria, visual inspection should suffice_.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Q3 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ In the context of an infinite random walk, the PageRank metric measures the proportion of time that the web surfer spends at each web page relative to all the other pages in the graph.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ The Markov property refers to the fact the next state of the process only depends on the current state and not the sequences of events that preceded it. In the context of PageRank, this means where the web surfer goes to next does not depend on where the web surfer has been in the past.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __c)__ The `n`, in our case, refers to the number of webpages on the internet. Since this is a huge number, our transition matrix will be huge as well.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __d)__ A right stochastic matrix is a real square matrix where each row sums to one. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __e)__ When we initially ran the power method for 10 iterations, the numbers did not converge. However, when we increased the number of iterations to 50, we observed that the values convered around the 38th iteration. Node E has the highest rank. This makes sense because Node E has incoming edges from Node B and Node C, which each have two incoming edges. **With Vinicio's suggestion, can converge in ~22 iterations**

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Seems easy right? Unfortunately applying this power iteration method directly to the web-graph actually runs into a few problems. In this question we'll tease apart what we meant by a 'nice graph' in Question 3 and highlight key modifications we'll have to make to the web-graph when performing PageRank. To start, we'll look at what goes wrong when we try to repeat our strategy from question 3 on a 'not nice' graph.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ What does it mean for a graph to be irreducible? Is the webgraph naturally irreducible? Explain your reasoning briefly.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) short response:__ What does it mean for a graph to be aperiodic? Is the webgraph naturally aperiodic? Explain your reasoning briefly.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __e) short response:__ What modification to the webgraph does PageRank make in order to guarantee aperiodicity and irreducibility? Interpret this modification in terms of our random surfer analogy.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Q4 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ It does not converge because node E is a dangling node, which has two incoming edges from nodes C and B and no outgoing edges; this makes it behave as a sink of mass. The states vector violates the stochastic property as it no longer sums to 1 but only to about 0.6.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ When the states vector is multiplied with the transition matrix everything at node E goes to zero so that information is lost and isn't utilized, so it does not converge. We could set all entries for node E to 1/4. This would evenly distribute everything back to the other nodes and the algorithm would converge.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __c)__ A graph is irreducible when there is a path from every node to every other node (there are no dangling nodes). For the webgraph to be naturally irreducible, every webpage should be connected to every other webpage on the internet, which is not the case.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __d)__ An aperiodic graph must have cycles, and the common divisor for the lengths of all cycles should not be greater than 1. We cannot guarantee that all cycles in the webgraph satisfy the aperiodic requirement considering the scale of webpages on the internet. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __e)__ Our PageRank algorithm guarantees aperiodicity and irreducibility by adding a teleportation matrix, which adds the self-link and adds connectivity from one page to every other page. When the random surfer makes a jump, the surfer can randomly switch to any other page on the internet, including the same page.

The number of intermediate records required to update PageRank is related to the number of edges in the graph. In this question you'll compute the average number of hyperlinks on each page in this data and visualize a distribution for these counts (the out-degree of the nodes).

# MAGIC %md # Question 7 - PageRank part 1 (Initialize the Graph)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC One of the challenges of performing distributed graph computation is that you must pass the entire graph structure through each iteration of your algorithm. As usual, we seek to design our computation so that as much work as possible can be done using the contents of a single record. In the case of PageRank, we'll need each record to include a node, its list of neighbors and its (current) rank. In this question you'll initialize the graph by creating a record for each dangling node and by setting the initial rank to 1/N for all nodes. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __`NOTE:`__ Your solution should _not_ hard code \\(N\\).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q7 Tasks:
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ What is \\(N\\)? Use the analogy of the infinite random web-surfer to explain why we'll initialize each node's rank to \\(\frac{1}{N}\\). (i.e. what is the probabilistic interpretation of this choice?)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Will it be more efficient to compute \\(N\\) before initializing records for each dangling node or after? Explain your reasoning.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) code:__ Fill in the missing code below to create a Spark job that:
# MAGIC   * parses each input record
# MAGIC   * creates a new record for any dangling nodes and sets it list of neighbors to be an empty set
# MAGIC   * initializes a rank of 1/N for each node
# MAGIC   * returns a pair RDD with records in the format specified by the docstring
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code:__ Run the provided code to confirm that your job in `part a` has a record for each node and that your should records match the format specified in the docstring and the count should match what you computed in question 5. [__`TIP:`__ _you might want to take a moment to write out what the expected output should be fore the test graph, this will help you know your code works as expected_]
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC __`NOTE:`__ Please observe scalability best practices in the design of your code & comment your work clearly. You will be graded on both the clarity and the design.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Q7 Student Answers:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __a)__ \\(N\\) represents the number of nodes in the graph. We initialize each node's rank to \\(\frac{1}{N}\\) to represent an equal probability of the web surfer being on any given page.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ It is easier to compute \\(N\\) after initializing records for each dangling node since we need \\(N\\) to include the dangling nodes, and counting the number of nodes in the original adjacency list will not include this count.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Finally we're ready to compute the page rank. In this last question you'll write a Spark job that iterates over the initialized graph updating each nodes score until it reaches a convergence threshold. The diagram below gives a visual overview of the process using a 5 node toy graph. Pay particular attention to what happens to the dangling mass at each iteration.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __`A Note about Notation:`__ The formula above describes how to compute the updated page rank for a node in the graph. The $P$ on the left hand side of the equation is the new score, and the $P$ on the right hand side of the equation represents the accumulated mass that was re-distributed from all of that node's in-links. Finally, $|G|$ is the number of nodes in the graph (which we've elsewhere refered to as $N$).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q8 Tasks:
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ In terms of the infinite random walk analogy, interpret the meaning of the first term in the PageRank calculation: $\alpha * \frac{1}{|G|}$
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ In the equation for the PageRank calculation above what does $m$ represent and why do we divide it by $|G|$?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ Keeping track of the total probability mass after each update is a good way to confirm that your algorithm is on track. How much should the total mass be after each iteration?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code:__ Fill in the missing code below to create a Spark job that take the initialized graph as its input then iterates over the graph and for each pass:
# MAGIC   * reads in each record and redistributes the node's current score to each of its neighbors
# MAGIC   * uses an accumulator to add up the dangling node mass and redistribute it among all the nodes. (_Don't forget to reset this accumulator after each iteration!_)
# MAGIC   * uses an accumulator to keep track of the total mass being redistributed.( _This is just for your own check, its not part of the PageRank calculation. Don't forget to reset this accumulator after each iteration._)
# MAGIC   * aggregates these partial scores for each node
# MAGIC   * applies telportation and damping factors as described in the formula above.
# MAGIC   * combine all of the above to compute the PageRank as described by the formula above.
# MAGIC   * 
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC    __WARNING:__ Some pages contain multiple hyperlinks to the same destination, please take this into account when redistributing the mass.
